# Installation Instructions (Running Locally)
If you wish to experiment, and test this program locally, running on your own machine, or development servers, please follow the guide below. *If you wish to run the program on Windows, ensure that you have PHP installed on Windows, and run the PHP file as appropriate to x86.*

### Unix/MacOS/Linux etc.:

**Prerequisites:**

* Homebrew (Linux/MacOS/Unix) is installed)
	* If not, please visit the [homebrew website](https://brew.sh), or run this command to install it on your machine: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

**Installation Guide:**

1. Clone this repository 
	- Recommended to use a CLI for this step, as it will make the process of running locally a lot smoother. 
	- `git clone https://github.com/nexuspcs/sdd-bus-tracker.git`
2. Ensure your working directory in your CLI is in the root folder of this newly-cloned repository
3. Ensure that the file `run-locally.sh` is visable.
4. Ensure that the file `run-locally.sh` is executable. 
	- This can be confirmed by running CMOD: `cmod +x run-locally.sh`. 
5. Run the `run-locally.sh` file: 
	- `./run-locally.sh`
6. This shell script will install **PHP** on your machine. 
	- If installed **already**, it will check for updates, as this shell script is simply running this command: `brew install php`
7. Ensure that you **DO NOT** interupt this script, as it may be in the process of updating PHP, without printing CLI log messages.
8. Once the script has confirmed the existence of PHP on your machine, it will wait a moment, and then open your OS' default web browser
	- If your web browser does not open automatically, navigate to the URL declared in the shell script: `http://localhost:9005/main.php`.

**Additional Information:**
